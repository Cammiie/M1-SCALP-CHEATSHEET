How It Works:
Bottoms Detection
The Williams VIX Fix formula calculates the percentage difference between the highest close over a specified period (pd) and the current low.
This value is then compared against:
Upper Bollinger Band (upperBand_bottom): Indicates overbought conditions.
Historical percentile high (rangeHigh_bottom): Highlights extreme volatility spikes.
A green histogram bar signals a potential buying opportunity when the Williams VIX Fix exceeds these thresholds.
Tops Detection
Similarly, the formula calculates the percentage difference between the lowest close over a specified period (pd) and the current high.
This value is compared against:
Lower Bollinger Band (lowerBand_top): Indicates oversold conditions.
Historical percentile low (rangeLow_top): Highlights extreme complacency.
A red histogram bar signals a potential selling opportunity when the Williams VIX Fix falls below these thresholds.
Combined View
In "Merged" mode, both tops and bottoms are displayed together, allowing traders to monitor both types of signals simultaneously.
